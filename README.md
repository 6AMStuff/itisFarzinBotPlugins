# Plugins for my Telegram bot

In this repo, I'll release my plugins which I wrote for my bot.

# Installation

For now, drag and drop the folders from here to the plugins folder inside of [itisFarzinBot](https://github.com/6AMStuff/itisFarzinBot), and after that install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` via the code below.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
